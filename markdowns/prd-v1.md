# Telex Server Monitor Agent

## Purpose

The Telex Server Monitor Agent is an npm package that monitors the health and performance of server infrastructure, ensuring optimal operation and preempting hardware or OS-level issues. Installed on a server, it collects comprehensive system data—such as CPU, memory, disk usage, network traffic, process statuses, and hardware health—and sends it to the Telex platform for real-time alerting. The collected data is also structured to enable analysis by an AI agent, providing actionable insights to prevent crashes, optimize performance, and maintain high availability.

## Goals

- Monitor critical server metrics and statuses to detect issues early
- Integrate seamlessly with Telex for configurable, real-time notifications
- Collect detailed, structured data for AI analysis to identify trends, anomalies, and optimization opportunities
- Focus on server-level infrastructure (hardware and OS), not application-specific monitoring

## Target Audience

- System administrators and DevOps engineers managing physical or virtual servers (e.g., VPS, cloud instances like droplets)
- Businesses reliant on server uptime and performance for critical operations

## Features

### 1. Authentication and Configuration

**Description:** Authenticate with Telex using email and password to fetch settings and an API token.

**Details:**

- Users provide their Telex email and password during setup to obtain a secure API token
- Token is stored locally (encrypted) and used for all subsequent interactions with Telex
- Settings fetched from a Telex endpoint include:
  - Channel IDs for alert delivery
  - Metrics/services to monitor (e.g., CPU, disk, specific services like nginx)
  - Thresholds for alerts (e.g., CPU > 85%, disk > 90%)
  - Monitoring toggle (on/off)
  - Data collection frequency (e.g., every 5 minutes)
- Configuration is centralized via Telex, ensuring users can adjust settings without redeploying the agent

### 2. System Metrics Monitoring

**Description:** Collect real-time server resource usage metrics.

**Details:**

- Metrics tracked:
  - CPU Usage: Overall percentage, per-core usage, and system load averages (1, 5, 15 minutes)
  - Memory Usage: Total, used, free, and swap memory (in bytes and percentage)
  - Disk Usage: Total, used, and free space per partition, plus disk I/O rates (read/write operations)
  - Network Traffic: Incoming and outgoing bytes per interface, plus packet counts
- Data is collected periodically (configurable via Telex settings) using cross-platform Node.js libraries (e.g., systeminformation)
- Metrics are timestamped and tagged with a server identifier (e.g., hostname or user-defined name)

### 3. Process and Service Monitoring

**Description:** Track the status and resource usage of system processes and services running on the server.

**Details:**

- Monitors:
  - Running Processes: List of active processes with PID, name, CPU/memory usage, and uptime
  - Key Services: Status (running, stopped, failed) of user-specified services (e.g., nginx, docker, ssh)
- Users configure which services to monitor via Telex settings (e.g., a list of service names relevant to their instance/droplet)
- Detects anomalies like service crashes or excessive resource consumption by a process
- Data is collected in a structured format (e.g., JSON) for AI analysis

### 4. Hardware Health Monitoring

**Description:** Monitor hardware-related metrics to detect potential failures.

**Details:**

- Metrics tracked (where supported by the OS/hardware):
  - Temperature: CPU and/or system temperature (in Celsius)
  - Fan Speed: RPM of cooling fans (if available)
  - Disk Health: SMART data indicating drive status (e.g., pending sectors, reallocated sectors)
- Limited by OS and hardware support; agent gracefully skips unavailable metrics without failing
- Alerts on critical conditions (e.g., temperature > 70°C) based on Telex-defined thresholds

### 5. OS-Level Log Monitoring

**Description:** Scan system logs for errors or critical events.

**Details:**

- Monitors logs such as:
  - Linux: /var/log/syslog or /var/log/messages
  - Windows: Event logs (system-related)
- Identifies patterns like kernel panics, OOM (out-of-memory) killer events, or hardware-related errors
- Users can specify log paths or keywords (e.g., "error", "fail") via Telex settings
- Logs are parsed and summarized (e.g., error count, last error message) for alerting and AI analysis

### 6. Alerting via Telex

**Description:** Send real-time alerts to Telex when thresholds are breached or issues are detected.

**Details:**

- Alert triggers:
  - Resource thresholds exceeded (e.g., CPU > 85%, disk > 90%)
  - Service/process failures (e.g., nginx stopped)
  - Hardware issues (e.g., high temperature, disk SMART warnings)
  - Critical log events (e.g., kernel error detected)
- Alert payload includes:
  - Server identifier
  - Metric/event type (e.g., "CPU Usage", "Service Failure")
  - Current value/status
  - Threshold (if applicable)
  - Timestamp
- Sent to one or more Telex channel IDs via webhook/API, as configured in settings

### 7. Data Collection for AI Analysis

**Description:** Structure and store collected data for analysis by an AI agent.

**Details:**

- All monitored data (metrics, process statuses, logs, hardware health) is aggregated into a structured JSON format
- Example payload:

```json
{
  "server_id": "prod-server-1",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-08T12:00:00Z",
  "metrics": {
    "cpu": { "usage": 75.2, "load_avg": [0.8, 0.9, 1.0] },
    "memory": { "total": 16e9, "used": 12e9, "free": 4e9 },
    "disk": { "/": { "total": 100e9, "used": 80e9, "free": 20e9 } },
    "network": { "eth0": { "rx_bytes": 1e6, "tx_bytes": 2e6 } }
  },
  "processes": [{ "pid": 1234, "name": "nginx", "cpu": 5.1, "memory": 200e6 }],
  "services": { "nginx": "running", "ssh": "running" },
  "hardware": { "cpu_temp": 55, "fan_speed": 3000 },
  "logs": { "errors": 2, "last_error": "kernel: disk I/O timeout" }
}
```

- Data is sent to Telex periodically (e.g., every 15 minutes) or on-demand for AI processing, separate from immediate alerts
- Telex stores this data, and an AI agent (outside this agent's scope) analyzes it for trends, predictions, or optimization recommendations

### 8. Uptime Tracking

**Description:** Monitor server uptime to ensure availability.

**Details:**

- Tracks how long the server has been running since the last reboot
- Reports unexpected reboots (e.g., uptime reset) as an alert
- Included in periodic data for AI analysis of stability patterns

## User Flow

### Installation

User installs the package on their server:

```bash
npm install telex-server-monitor
```

### Setup

User runs the setup command:

```bash
npx telex-server-monitor setup --email <email> --password <password> [--server-name "prod-server-1"]
```

Agent:

- Authenticates with Telex to fetch an API token
- Stores token securely in ~/.telex-monitor/config.json
- Optionally accepts a custom server name (defaults to hostname)

### Configuration via Telex

User logs into Telex to define:

- Metrics to monitor (e.g., CPU, disk, services)
- Thresholds (e.g., CPU > 85%)
- Services to track (e.g., nginx, docker)
- Channel IDs for alerts and data
  Settings are saved and fetched by the agent on startup

### Start Monitoring

User launches the agent:

```bash
npx telex-server-monitor start
```

Agent:

- Loads token and fetches settings from Telex
- Begins collecting metrics, process statuses, logs, and hardware data
- Sends alerts for threshold breaches or issues
- Periodically sends structured data to Telex for AI analysis

### Stop Monitoring

User stops the agent:

```bash
npx telex-server-monitor stop
```

Agent shuts down gracefully, ceasing all monitoring

## Use Cases

### Preventing Server Crashes

- Detects resource exhaustion (e.g., memory > 95%) and alerts before a crash occurs
- AI analyzes trends to predict when resources might run out

### Identifying Hardware Failures

- Monitors temperature or disk health to catch failing components early
- Alerts on critical conditions; AI correlates hardware data with performance

### Optimizing Server Performance

- Tracks CPU/memory usage and process bottlenecks
- AI suggests optimizations (e.g., "High CPU from X process; consider scaling")

### Ensuring High Availability

- Monitors uptime and service statuses to maintain operational continuity
- AI identifies patterns of instability (e.g., frequent reboots)
