# **Telex Server Monitor - Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Overview**

Telex Server Monitor is a server monitoring integration that helps system administrators track server health, detect anomalies, and receive alerts via the Telex platform. The integration consists of an agent installed on the server, which collects and reports key metrics to Telex.

## **Version 1.0 - Installation & Basic CPU Monitoring**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to install the Telex Server Monitor integration and start monitoring CPU usage so that I can track performance and detect high CPU utilization.

### **How It Works**

1. The user installs the Telex Server Monitor Integration in their Telex organization.
2. The user runs a setup command in Telex to generate a cURL URL for installing the agent on their server.
3. The user executes the installation script on the server to download and configure the agent.
4. The agent starts collecting and sending system metrics to Telex.

### **Features**

1. **Telex Integration** - Users register the integration within their Telex organization.
2. **Agent Installation** - Users install the agent via an installation script generated from Telex.
3. **CPU Usage Tracking** - The agent collects total CPU usage and sends structured JSON data to Telex.
4. **Default Threshold Alerts** - Alerts trigger when CPU usage exceeds 85%.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Users can register the integration in Telex.
- The agent can be installed using the generated cURL command.
- The agent collects and sends CPU usage data.
- Alerts trigger when CPU usage exceeds the threshold.

## **Version 1.1 - Custom CPU Thresholds**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to set custom CPU usage thresholds so that I can define when alerts are triggered.

### **Features**

1. **Configurable CPU Thresholds** - Users set CPU thresholds via Telex.
2. **Dynamic Updates** - The agent fetches updated thresholds from Telex.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Users can configure CPU thresholds in Telex.
- The agent triggers alerts based on the configured thresholds.

---

## **Version 1.2 - CPU Load Average Monitoring**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to track CPU load averages so that I can analyze server performance over time.

### **Features**

1. **Load Average Tracking** - The agent collects 1, 5, and 15-minute load averages.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- The agent collects and reports CPU load averages to Telex.

---

## **Version 1.3 - Per-Core CPU Monitoring**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to monitor CPU usage per core so that I can identify imbalances in CPU load.

### **Features**

1. **Per-Core Tracking** - The agent reports usage for each CPU core.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- The agent collects and sends per-core CPU usage data to Telex.

---

## **Version 1.4 - Memory Monitoring**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to monitor memory usage so that I can detect high memory consumption.

### **Features**

1. **Memory Usage Tracking** - The agent reports total, used, and available memory.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- The agent collects and sends memory usage data to Telex.

---

## **Version 1.5 - Custom Memory Thresholds**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to set custom memory usage thresholds so that I can control alerting conditions.

### **Features**

1. **Configurable Memory Thresholds** - Users set thresholds via Telex.
2. **Dynamic Updates** - The agent fetches updated thresholds from Telex.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Users can configure memory thresholds in Telex.
- The agent triggers alerts based on configured thresholds.

---

## **Version 1.6 - Disk Usage Monitoring**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to monitor disk usage so that I can prevent storage issues.

### **Features**

1. **Disk Space Tracking** - The agent reports total, used, and available disk space.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- The agent collects and sends disk usage data to Telex.

---

## **Version 1.7 - Custom Disk Thresholds**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to set custom disk usage thresholds so that I can receive alerts before storage runs low.

### **Features**

1. **Configurable Disk Thresholds** - Users set thresholds via Telex.
2. **Dynamic Updates** - The agent fetches updated thresholds from Telex.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Users can configure disk thresholds in Telex.
- The agent triggers alerts based on configured thresholds.

---

## **Version 1.8 - Service Monitoring**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to monitor specific services so that I can detect crashes and failures.

### **Features**

1. **Service Status Tracking** - The agent checks if services are running.
2. **Service Failure Alerts** - Alerts trigger when a monitored service stops.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- Users can specify services to monitor.
- The agent reports service status and triggers alerts on failures.

---

## **Version 1.9 - Process Monitoring**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to track running processes so that I can detect high resource usage.

### **Features**

1. **Process Tracking** - The agent collects process CPU and memory usage.
2. **Top Processes Report** - Identifies top-consuming processes.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- The agent collects and sends process data to Telex.
- Users receive alerts when processes exceed resource limits.

---

## **Version 1.10 - Uptime Tracking**

### **User Story**

> As a system administrator, I want to track server uptime so that I can detect unexpected reboots.

### **Features**

1. **Uptime Monitoring** - The agent reports uptime since last reboot.
2. **Unexpected Reboot Alerts** - Alerts trigger on unplanned reboots.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- The agent tracks and reports uptime to Telex.
- Alerts trigger on unexpected reboots.
