🚀 *Server Monitoring Setup Guide*

Welcome to the Server Monitoring Setup! Let's get your server up and running with our monitoring agent in just a few simple steps.

1. **Open Your Server's Terminal**
   - Log into your server using SSH or access the terminal directly if you're on the server itself.

2. **Run the Installation Command**
   - Copy and paste the following command into your terminal:
\`\`\`
${installCommand}
\`\`\`
   - This command will:
     - Download the installation script from our GitHub repository
     - Automatically install the monitoring agent on your server
     - Configure the agent with your unique channel ID
     - Start the monitoring service

3. **Wait for the Installation to Complete**
   - The script will run and provide you with status updates. This might take a few minutes depending on your server's speed and internet connection.

4. **Verify the Installation**
   - Once the script finishes, you should see a confirmation message that the agent is installed and running.
   - You can check the agent's status by running:
\`\`\`
systemctl status server-monitor-agent
\`\`\`
   - If everything is set up correctly, you should see that the service is active and running.

5. **Start Receiving Alerts**
   - That's it! Your server is now being monitored. You'll start receiving alerts and metrics reports in this Telex channel.

✨ *What's Next?*
- You'll receive periodic updates on your server's health, including CPU usage, memory consumption, and more.
- If any issues are detected, you'll get immediate notifications to take action.

❓ *Need Help?*
- If you encounter any issues during setup, or if you have questions about the monitoring agent, please visit our documentation at ${IntegrationConstants.Github.Repository}
- You can also reach out to our support team through the same link.

Thank you for choosing our Server Monitoring service! We're here to help keep your servers running smoothly.
